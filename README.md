Hosting a Simple Web Application on Azure**  

*I. Introduction* 

To host a simple web application, I would use Azure App Service. It is a managed platform that simplifies building, deploying, and scaling web applications. 

*II. Cost Considerations* 

To save money, I would: - Start with the free tier of Azure App Service. 
- Store static content in Azure Blob Storage. 
- Automatically adjust resources based on demand using autoscaling. 
- Use Azure’s cost management tools to monitor and reduce expenses. 

*III. Scalability Considerations* 

To ensure the web application can handle an increasing number of users, I would: 
- Design a scalable architecture with Azure App Service plans. 
- Enable autoscaling to adjust resources based on demand. 
- Use Azure’s content delivery network (CDN) to globally distribute content. 
- ⁠- Implement traffic load balancing across multiple instances.

*IV. Security Considerations* 

To secure the web application, I would:
- Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for user authentication and authorization. 
- Encrypt data both in transit and at rest. 
- ⁠- Implement network security groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall to control access. 
- ⁠- Monitor security incidents using Azure’s monitoring and logging tools.

V. Conclusion

In summary, my approach to hosting a simple web application on azure involves:

* Using Azure App Service for a managed platform 
* Saving cost with cost-effective services and auto scaling 
* Scaling up with a scalable architecture and load balancing 
* Security my app with AAD, encryption and monitoring.
